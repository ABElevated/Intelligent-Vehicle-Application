# Intelligent-Vehicle-Application
I created an Android application that interacts with the ECU system of an electric car. User of application would be able to notify other nearby users regarding for example accidents, hard wheel turns, holes in the concrete, etc. Vehicle2Vehicle communication with proof of concept shown through Android application.
I Hacked the brain of the car through it's OBD, manipulated the data stream to find out the PID's for the wanted elements.
I used this data stream to create an android app to illustrate proof of concept of a potential concept that could be implemented in cars.
I was suggested to go through with it and finish the real product by my professor, however, I lost interest.
